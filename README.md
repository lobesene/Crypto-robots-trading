# Crypto-robots-Trading
TD2 Blockchain programming

This is a Project/Practical Work, destined to create a cryptocurrency trading robot(s).
I chose 2 exchanges/crypto markets Binance and Kraken. Thanks to their API, I retreive data 
that I process in JavaScript.
Goal: Build a scalable function able to retreive, process, and notify specific positions wich seem interesting.

-------------For the time being The difficulty relies on the rest API responses comparaison----------
